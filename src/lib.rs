#![feature(min_const_generics)]

//! async-wormhole allows you to call `.await` async calls across non-async functions, like extern "C" or JIT
//! generated code.
//!
//! ## Motivation
//!
//! Sometimes, when running inside an async environment you need to call into JIT generated code (e.g. wasm)
//! and .await from there. Because the JIT code is not available at compile time, the Rust compiler can't
//! do their "create a state machine" magic. In the end you can't have `.await` statements in non-async
//! functions.
//!
//! This library creates a special stack for executing the JIT code, so it's possible to suspend it at any
//! point of the execution. Once you pass it a closure inside [AsyncWormhole::new](struct.AsyncWormhole.html#method.new)
//! you will get back a future that you can `.await` on. The passed in closure is going to be executed on a
//! new stack.
//!
//! Sometimes you also need to preserve thread local storage as the code inside the closure expects it to stay
//! the same, but the actual execution can be moved between threads. There is a
//! [proof of concept API](struct.AsyncWormhole.html#method.new_with_tls)
//! to allow you to move your thread local storage with the closure across threads.
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! ```rust
//! use async_wormhole::{AsyncWormhole, AsyncYielder};
//! use switcheroo::stack::*;
//!
//! // non-async function
//! extern "C" fn non_async(mut yielder: AsyncYielder<u32>) -> u32 {
//! 	// Suspend the runtime until async value is ready.
//! 	// Can contain .await calls.
//!     yielder.async_suspend(async { 42 })
//! }
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     let stack = EightMbStack::new().unwrap();
//!     let task = AsyncWormhole::new(stack, |yielder| {
//!         let result = non_async(yielder);
//!         assert_eq!(result, 42);
//!         64
//!     })
//!     .unwrap();
//!
//!     let outside = futures::executor::block_on(task);
//!     assert_eq!(outside.unwrap(), 64);
//! }
//! ```
